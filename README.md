socialbookmark-tinyurl
=======================

This project consists of a hook and an extension. You first have to install the extension.
After installing the extension the hook modifies the social bookmark functionality to call the extension to generate a tinyurl.

This way you have more space for writing your own words in (for example) a 'share on twitter' message.
